# prolog-plus-plus
An exercise in writing a prolog interpreter in C++, the main aim is to figure out at which point I start struggling and need to read about some computer science theory.

## Current features:
* you can check the truth of hard coded facts
* you can say things like person(X). and get which X's work


## ToDo List:
* Do some kind of checking for horn clauses and do SLD resolution
* allow consulting from file
* more useful error messages
