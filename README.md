# prolog-plus-plus
An exercise in writing a prolog interpreter in C++, the main aim is to figure out at which point I start struggling and need to read about some computer science theory.

## Current features:
* you can check the truth of hard coded facts


## ToDo List:
* allow consulting from file
* more useful error messages
* get free variables to work
* get statements after the :- symbol to work
* get equality operators to work
